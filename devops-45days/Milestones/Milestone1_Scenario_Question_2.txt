Batch 4 - Milestone 1
SCENARIO-BASED QUESTION 1: Development Team Log Management
================================================================================

SCENARIO DESCRIPTION:
You are a Junior DevOps Engineer at WebApp Solutions. The development team has been working on a new web application and they generate lots of log files during development and testing. The team lead has asked you to help them manage these log files better.

CURRENT SITUATION:
The development team has the following issues:
- Log files are scattered across different directories: /var/log/app/, /tmp/debug/, and ~/logs/
- Some log files are very large (over 100MB) and slowing down the system
- Developers can't easily find error messages in the log files
- Old log files from last month are still taking up disk space
- The team wants a daily summary of errors and warnings

WHAT THE TEAM NEEDS:
1. A way to find all log files on the system
2. Identify which log files are too large (over 50MB)
3. Count how many ERROR and WARNING messages are in today's logs
4. Clean up log files older than 7 days
5. Create a simple daily report

SAMPLE LOG FILE CONTENT:
```
2024-01-15 09:30:15 INFO Application started successfully
2024-01-15 09:30:20 INFO Database connection established  
2024-01-15 09:35:10 ERROR Connection timeout to database
2024-01-15 09:35:15 WARNING Retrying database connection
2024-01-15 09:35:20 INFO Database connection restored
2024-01-15 09:40:05 ERROR Disk space low on /var partition
2024-01-15 09:45:30 INFO Daily backup completed successfully
```

YOUR TASKS:

PART A: BASIC LINUX COMMANDS (30 points)
Write the Linux commands to:
1. Find all files with .log extension in the system
2. Display the size of each log file in human-readable format
3. Show the first 10 lines of a log file called "app.log"
4. Show the last 20 lines of the same log file
5. Count the total number of lines in all .log files

PART B: TEXT PROCESSING (25 points)
Write Linux commands to:
1. Find all lines containing "ERROR" in a log file
2. Count how many ERROR messages are in the log file
3. Find all lines containing either "ERROR" or "WARNING"
4. Display only the timestamp and message (remove the log level)
5. Sort the log entries by timestamp

PART C: SIMPLE SHELL SCRIPT (35 points)
Create a shell script called "log_manager.sh" that:
1. Checks if log files exist in the three directories
2. Lists all log files larger than 50MB
3. Counts ERROR and WARNING messages in today's logs
4. Deletes log files older than 7 days
5. Creates a simple summary report

PART D: AUTOMATION BASICS (10 points)
1. Explain how you would run this script automatically every day
2. How would you make the script executable?
3. What would you do if the script fails to run?
