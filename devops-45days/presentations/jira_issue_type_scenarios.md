## 🎪 **Facilitation Tips**

### **During the Exercise:**
1. **Encourage Debate:** Let teams discuss and disagree - this builds understanding
2. **Ask "Why":** Push teams to explain their reasoning, not just their choice
3. **Real-World Context:** Remind them to think like actual project managers
4. **Time Management:** Keep teams moving - 5 minutes per scenario maximum

### **During Presentations:**
1. **No "Wrong" Answers:** Focus on reasoning quality over "correct" categorization
2. **Alternative Views:** Ask other teams if they categorized differently and why
3. **Learning Moments:** Highlight when teams show good project management thinking
4. **Practical Application:** Connect decisions back to real Jira usage

### **Key Learning Points to Emphasize:**
- **Size and Scope:** Epics are months of work, Stories are weeks, Tasks are days
- **User Value:** Stories deliver direct user benefit, Tasks are technical work
- **Independence:** Can this be completed and tested on its own?
- **Hierarchy:** Sub-tasks are always part of something larger
- **Context Matters:** Same requirement might be different issue types in different contexts

This exercise will give participants practical experience in the critical project management skill of breaking down requirements and organizing work effectively in Jira!
