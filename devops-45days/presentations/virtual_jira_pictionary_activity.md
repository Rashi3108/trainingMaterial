## 🛠️ **Virtual Setup Requirements**

### **Technology Stack:**
- **Video Platform:** Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or Google Meet
- **Digital Whiteboard:** Choose one:
  - **Miro** (recommended - easy sharing)
  - **Jamboard** (Google - simple interface)
  - **Whiteboard.fi** (no signup required)
  - **Zoom Whiteboard** (built-in option)

### **Pre-Activity Setup (5 minutes before):**
1. Create 6 breakout rooms named "Team 1" through "Team 6"
2. Set up 6 separate Miro boards (or chosen tool)
3. Share board links in chat
4. Test screen sharing capabilities

## 🎮 **Virtual Game Mechanics**

### **Option A: Breakout Room Style (Recommended)**

#### **Setup:**
- 6 breakout rooms with 5 people each
- Each room gets their own digital whiteboard
- Facilitator "visits" rooms to give words and check progress
- Teams compete against each other

#### **How It Works:**
1. **Round Start:** Facilitator broadcasts word to all rooms via chat
2. **Drawing Phase:** One person per team draws on their whiteboard (90 seconds)
3. **Guessing Phase:** Team members guess in their breakout room
4. **Scoring:** Teams report back to main room with their score

### **Option B: Main Room Spotlight Style**

#### **Setup:**
- Everyone stays in main room
- Teams take turns being "on stage"
- One shared whiteboard visible to all
- More spectator-friendly but less participation

#### **How It Works:**
1. Call up "Team 1" 
2. One person shares screen and draws
3. Their team guesses (mics on)
4. Everyone else watches and cheers
5. Rotate through all 6 teams
