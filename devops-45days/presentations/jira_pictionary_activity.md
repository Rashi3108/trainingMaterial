## 📝 **Learning Reinforcement**

### **After the Activity:**
*"Let's quickly review some of the terms we just drew:*
- *Who can tell me what a 'swimlane' actually does in Jira?*
- *What's the difference between an Epic and a Story?*
- *Why might you want to look at a burndown chart?"*

### **Connection to Training:**
*"Notice how much easier it was to remember these terms when you had to visualize them? Jira works the same way - it takes abstract work and makes it visual on boards and charts!"*

---

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting Tips**

### **If teams are stuck:**
- Give a small hint: "Think about what this would look like in real life"
- Allow team consultation: "Your team can help with ideas!"

### **If it's too easy:**
- Add time pressure: "Next round is 60 seconds!"
- Use only hard cards: "Expert level only!"

### **If it's too hard:**
- Mix in more easy cards
- Allow one word clues from drawer

---

**This activity perfectly bridges the gap between learning Jira concepts and having fun - your participants will remember these terms much better after drawing and guessing them!**
