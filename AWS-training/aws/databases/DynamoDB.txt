1. DynamoDB is a fully managed, serverless, NoSQL database by AWS.
2. Scales automatically to millions of requests per seconds and scales down when there is no traffic.
3. Highly available across multiple AZs by default.
4. Tables - collection of items like an excel sheet
5. Each table must have a primary key to uniquely identify items.

6. primary Key - > 2 options 
6.1 Partition Key Only -> Example: userID -> DynamoDB uses the key to decide which partition stores the data.
6.2 Partition key + Sort Key -> Example UserID + OrderDate -> This lets you store multiple items with the same partition key but sort them.

7. Capacity Modes: DynamoDB offers 2 billing and scaling models
7.1 Provisioned Mode -> You specify RCU(Read capacity Unit) and WCU(Write Capacity Unit) -> good for predictable workloads
7.2 On-demand Mode -> You pay per request -> SynamoDB automatically scales up/down -> Best for unpredictable workloads.
